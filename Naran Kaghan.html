<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Saiful Muluk was formed by glacial moraines that blocked the water of the stream passing through the valley.[5] The Kaghan Valley was formed in the greater Pleistocene Period dating back almost 300,000 years when the area was covered with ice. Rising temperatures and receding glaciers left a large depression where glaciers once stood. Melting water collected into the lake.</p>
